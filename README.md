# Personal Webpage

This is the code for my personal website. Initially created  during the 2019 Summer of Tech git tutorial. 

## Development

The majority of this website is written using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Generating pages from Template**
For easy support of multiple languages, I created a little script which takes an HTML 
template, a JSON content file and returns a populated HTML file. This can be found in 
the [template](./template/) folder.

## Deployment

This website is deployed using the GitHub pages default deploy action.
