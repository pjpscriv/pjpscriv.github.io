# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator.

## Development

The site is structured using Hugo's content, layout, and data directories. Most pages and components are managed through Hugo's templating system, with some custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript for additional features.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages via the default deploy action.

_Originally created during the 2019 [Summer of Tech](https://www.summeroftech.co.nz/) git tutorial, using the [fluxfederation/hello-summer](https://github.com/fluxfederation/hello-summer) template._
