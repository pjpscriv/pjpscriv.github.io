# Tasks

Things I want to update.

To help the LLM keep track what work has been done and what's left to do. 

Except it's me, I'm the LLM.

- [x] In experience list, move the icons inside the circles
- Projects page
  - [x] Make the name a link at the small breakpoint
  - [ ] Add a "fork", "personal project", "little tool", icon for each project
- [x] Add "Back to home" page links
- [x] Add a "view page on github" link in the footer too
- [x] In writing preview, add a "X min read" and "X words" property
- On posts
  - [x] Remove day name from format
  - [x] Add word count and "time to read"
- [x] In the header, reduce the left and right padding at the mobile breakpoint

### Later

- [ ] Add "copy link to this header" icon for all `<h2>`, etc elements 
- [ ] Add table of contents shortcode
