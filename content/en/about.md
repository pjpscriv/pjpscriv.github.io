I'm Peter, a Software Engineer from Aotearoa New Zealand. I've recently moved to Montr√©al, Canada üçÅ having spent the past 5 years working for [Trade Me](https://trademe.co.nz) in NZ.

I'm passionate, friendly, and excited about building interesting systems that solve important problems. I'm currently learning French and spending a bit more time tinkering in small open source projects.

In my spare time I play guitar and ski. I like [podcasts](https://lists.pocketcasts.com/2d425db2-b2c1-4999-be5a-63840ff200d5), [Studio Ghibli movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Studio_Ghibli_works#Feature_films) and making [silly things in code](http://pjpscriv.com/animal-spin/) for fun. I've helped make [an album](https://ingridandtheministers.bandcamp.com/album/kill-the-sights), [a theatre show](https://tldrify.com/vev), and [an album during a theatre show](https://www.aucklandfringe.co.nz/programme-2019/how-to-write-an-album).
