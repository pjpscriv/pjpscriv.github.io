## Templating "Engine"

This is a simple Node script that reads the `template.html`, populates it with 
content from the JSON files in the `inputs` folder, and writes the results to
their specified output locations.

### Running

Simply run the script with node from within this directory:
```shell
node generateHtml.js
```
